# OPTCG Tracker — Complete Project Documentation

> **One Piece TCG Portfolio Tracker** — A Finary-inspired fintech application for tracking, analyzing, and managing One Piece Trading Card Game collections.

---

## 1. Project Objective

OPTCG Tracker is a **portfolio management platform** purpose-built for One Piece TCG collectors and investors. Inspired by the UX of financial portfolio trackers like [Finary](https://finary.com), it allows users to:

- Track the real-time market value of their card collection
- Monitor price trends and profit/loss (P&L) over time
- Analyze portfolio diversification across sets, colors, types, and rarities
- Manage wishlists with target-price alerts, edit targets, and convert to portfolio
- Export collection data and share public profiles
- Receive notifications on price spikes, drops, and wishlist targets
- Organize collections into binders with custom colors

The app treats **trading cards as investable assets**, providing the same analytical depth collectors would expect from a stock or crypto portfolio tracker.

### 3.2 Subfolder-Based Routing

The application uses a **standard subfolder-based routing architecture** with clear separation between public and authenticated areas:

| Path Pattern | Routing Target | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `/` (root) | `app/page.tsx` | Public landing page, legal pages (terms, privacy) |
| `/login` / `/register` | `app/(auth)/*` | Authentication pages |
| `/app/*` | `app/app/(dashboard)/*` | Authenticated dashboard application |
| `/api/*` | `app/api/*` | Shared API routes (auth, cron, health) |
| `/p/[username]` | `app/p/[username]` | Public portfolio profiles |

Authentication is enforced at the middleware level (`proxy.ts`) for all routes starting with `/app`.

### 3.5 Server/Client Boundary Strategy

To keep the application fast and SEO-friendly, the dashboard follows a specific layout pattern (documented in `docs/REF_PATTERNS.md`):

**Pattern**: `DashboardLayout` (Server) → `DashboardShell` (Client) → `Children` (Server)

| Component | Type | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `app/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` | Server Component | Async data fetching, auth verification |
| `components/dashboard/DashboardShell.tsx` | Client Component | Interactive elements (hotkeys, modals, state) |
| `components/dashboard/Sidebar.tsx` | Server Component | Static navigation (no client-side hydration) |
| `components/dashboard/UserProfile.tsx` | Server Component | User display (no interactive state) |

**Guideline**: If a component exceeds **300 lines**, extract its state and logic into a custom hook (e.g., `usePortfolioFilters` reduced `PortfolioClient.tsx` from 1270 to ~400 lines).

### 3.6 Middleware & Routing

The middleware is defined in `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 convention):

```
NextAuth(authConfig).auth → Route Protection
```

- **Auth Guard**: NextAuth authorized callback protects all `/app/*` routes.
- **Matcher Pattern**: Excludes static files, images, `manifest.json`, and `sw.js`.

```
matcher: ['/((?!_next/static|_next/image|.*\\.(?:png|ico|svg|webp|jpg|jpeg)$|manifest\\.json|sw\\.js).*)']
```

### 3.7 Performance Standards

From `docs/REF_PATTERNS.md`:

| Standard | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Dynamic Imports** | `next/dynamic` for all heavy modals and charting libraries (e.g., `recharts`) |
| **Skeleton Screens** | Every major view has a `Skeleton` component (e.g., `PortfolioSkeleton.tsx`) to eliminate CLS |
| **Suspense Transitions** | `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>` at page level for data-heavy views |
| **Component Modularity** | Large views split into sub-components: `PortfolioStats`, `PortfolioGridItem`, `PortfolioTable` |
| **Centralized Logic** | All P&L math in `lib/utils/calculations.ts` — never inline in components |

---

## 8. Server Actions (Data Layer)

All data mutations and queries are implemented as **Next.js Server Actions** with `'use server'` directives:

| Module | Key Functions | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| `cards.ts` | Card querying with pagination and filters | Card catalog data fetching |
| `wishlist.ts` | `addToWishlist`, `removeFromWishlist`, `updateWishlistItem`, `convertWishlistToPortfolio`, `getWishlistItems`, `getWishlistAlerts` | Wishlist management with edit + convert |
| `prices.ts` | `updateAllCardPrices`, `fetchPriceForCard` | Price scraping from LimitlessTCG with batch concurrency, timeout protection, notification cooldown, and execution telemetry |
| `performance.ts` | `getPerformanceData`, `generateInsights` | 30-day performance charts, top movers, dynamic insights |
| `allocation.ts` | `getAllocationData` | Asset breakdown by set, color, type, rarity + set completion |
| `history.ts` | `getPortfolioHistory` | Historical portfolio value with configurable ranges (7D-MAX) |
| `notifications.ts` | `getNotifications`, `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead`, `deleteNotification` | Notification management |
| `binders.ts` | `getBinders`, `createBinder`, `updateBinder`, `deleteBinder`, `addItemsToBinder`, `removeItemsFromBinder` | Collection organization |
| `set-progress.ts` | `getSetProgress`, `getAllSetsProgress` | Set completion with dual core/mastery metrics |

| `public-portfolio.ts` | `getPublicPortfolio` | Public profile data fetching |

**Data pattern** used by all server actions:

```
1. Check authentication (session.user.id)
2. Validate input with Zod schema
3. Execute Prisma query/mutation
4. revalidatePath('/', 'layout') for ISR cache invalidation
5. Return { success, data } or { error }
```

function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string
```

### 9.2 Financial Calculations

**Location**: `lib/utils/calculations.ts`

| Function | Signature | Returns |
|---|---|---|

| `formatPnLPrefix` | `(pnl: number)` | `'+'` if positive, `''` otherwise |
| `getPnLColor` | `(pnl: number)` | `'text-green-400'` / `'text-red-400'` / `'text-muted-foreground'` |

**Logic**: `cost = quantity * purchasePrice`, `value = quantity * currentPrice`, `pnlPercent = cost > 0 ? (pnl / cost) * 100 : 0`.

### 9.3 Market Timing Badge

**Location**: `lib/performance.ts`

```typescript
function getMarketTimingBadge(purchasePrice: number, history: PriceHistory[]): { badge: TimingBadge; color: string }
```

---

## 12. API Endpoints

### 12.1 Health Check — `GET /api/health`

**Auth**: None required

**Response (200)**:
```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "uptime": 12345.67,
    "db": { "status": "connected", "latencyMs": 5 },
    "timestamp": "2026-04-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Error (503)**: Returns `{ status: "error", db: { status: "disconnected" } }` when database is unreachable.

**DB Check**: Raw SQL `SELECT 1` for connectivity test.

### 12.2 Price Update CRON — `GET /api/cron/update-prices`

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `dynamic` | `'force-dynamic'` |
| `maxDuration` | `300` (5 minutes, Vercel function limit) |
| **Schedule** | `*/5 * * * *` (Every 5 minutes via `vercel.json`) |

**Auth**: Bearer token — `Authorization: Bearer {CRON_SECRET}`

- In **production**: `CRON_SECRET` is mandatory; endpoint returns 500 if not set. Automated via Vercel Cron Jobs.
- In **non-production**: Auth enforced only when `CRON_SECRET` is configured.

**Response**:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "updated": 42,
    "skipped": 150,
    "errors": 3,
    "processed": 195,
    "batchSize": 5,
    "durationMs": 45000,
    "requestDurationMs": 45123,
    "triggeredAt": "2026-04-02T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 12.3 Auth — `/api/auth/[...nextauth]`

Exports `GET` and `POST` handlers from NextAuth.js. Handles login, callback, session, and signout flows.

---

## 13. External Integrations

### 13.1 LimitlessTCG (Price Data Source)

- **Purpose**: Scrapes card prices from `onepiece.limitlesstcg.com/cards/{code}`
- **Method**: HTML scraping with multiple regex patterns for robustness
- **Batch Concurrency**: Processes cards in configurable batches (default: 5) with inter-batch delays
- **Timeout Protection**: 12-second fetch timeout with cleanup via `AbortController`
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with up to 2 retries per card
- **Notification Cooldown**: 12-hour cooldown per card/type to prevent spam
- **Execution Telemetry**: Tracks `updated`, `skipped`, `errors`, `durationMs`, `batchSize`
- **Trigger**: Via CRON API endpoint (`/api/cron/update-prices`)

### 13.2 Marketplace Deep Links

The app generates deep links to three marketplaces for each card:

| Platform | URL Builder | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **TCGPlayer** | `getTCGPlayerUrl()` | Buy/sell with search pre-populated |
| **Cardmarket** | `getCardmarketUrl()` | European marketplace links |
| **eBay** | `getEbayUrl()` | Completed/sold listings for price research |

### 13.3 Card Images

Card images are loaded from two CDN sources:
- `images.limitlesstcg.com`
- `limitlesstcg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`

Fallback placeholder: `placehold.co`

### 13.4 Exchange Rates

- **Source**: `open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD`
- **Used by**: `useCurrency` hook for multi-currency conversion
- **Cache**: 12-hour TTL in localStorage

---

## 14. Rate Limiting

**Location**: `lib/rate-limit.ts`

**Algorithm**: In-memory fixed-window rate limiter using a `Map<string, { count, resetTime }>`.

### 14.1 Rate Limit Tiers

| Tier | Max Requests | Window | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | 10 | 60 seconds | Login/register attempts |
| `api` | 60 | 60 seconds | General API calls (default) |
| `heavy` | 5 | 60 seconds | Heavy operations (price sync, bulk delete) |

### 14.2 Implementation Details

- **Key Format**: `{type}:{identifier}` (e.g., `auth:username123`)
- **Cleanup**: `setInterval` every 60 seconds removes expired entries
- **Function**: `checkRateLimit(identifier: string, type: 'auth' | 'api' | 'heavy')`
- **Returns**: `{ success: boolean, remaining: number, resetInMs: number }`

---

## 15. Price Update Engine

**Location**: `lib/actions/prices.ts`

### 15.1 Configuration Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PRICE_CHANGE_THRESHOLD` | `0.15` (15%) | Minimum change to trigger spike/drop notifications |
| `NOTIFICATION_COOLDOWN_HOURS` | `12` | Hours before re-notifying for same card/type |
| `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `12,000` | Per-card fetch timeout (AbortController) |
| `PRICE_UPDATE_BATCH_SIZE` | `5` | Cards processed concurrently per batch |
| `PRICE_UPDATE_BATCH_DELAY_MS` | `500` | Delay between batches (rate limiting protection) |

### 15.2 Scraping Strategy

1. **URL**: `https://onepiece.limitlesstcg.com/cards/{code}`
2. **User-Agent**: Chrome 120 spoofing
3. **Timeout**: 12s with `AbortController`
4. **Retry**: Up to 2 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s)
5. **Price Extraction** (3 regex patterns tried in order):
   - **Pattern 1**: TCGPlayer price link — `$X.XX</a>`
   - **Pattern 2**: Generic price container — `class="*price*">$X.XX`
   - **Pattern 3**: Fallback — first `$X.XX` occurrence
6. **Validation**: Price must be > 0 and < 100,000

### 15.3 Notification Logic

All operations run within a single `prisma.$transaction`:

1. **Update card price** + create `PriceHistory` entry
2. **Wishlist targets**: If price changed and crossed below a user's `targetPrice`:
   - Check `user.alertMilestones` is enabled
   - Check 12h notification cooldown
   - Create `WISHLIST_TARGET` notification with link to `/wishlist`
3. **Price spikes** (>= +15%): Notify portfolio holders
   - Check `user.alertPriceSpike` is enabled
   - Check 12h cooldown
   - Create `PRICE_SPIKE` notification with link to `/cards/{id}`
4. **Price drops** (<= -15%): Notify portfolio holders
   - Check `user.alertPriceDrop` is enabled
   - Check 12h cooldown
   - Create `PRICE_DROP` notification with link to `/cards/{id}`

### 15.4 Telemetry

`updateAllCardPrices()` returns:

```typescript
{ success: true, updated: number, skipped: number, errors: number, processed: number, batchSize: number, durationMs: number }
```

## 16. Security & Authentication

### 16.1 Authentication Architecture

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth.config.ts` | Edge-compatible config: callbacks, route protection, JWT strategy |
| `auth.ts` | Full config with Prisma + Credentials provider (not edge-compatible) |
| `proxy.ts` | Next.js 16 middleware wrapping NextAuth auth guard |

**Provider**: Credentials (username + password)
**Strategy**: JWT sessions (no database sessions for performance)
**Password Storage**: bcryptjs hashing
**Config**: `trustHost: true`, `basePath: "/api/auth"`, `secret: AUTH_SECRET`

### 16.2 Authentication Flow

1. **Register**: Validate with `registerSchema` → hash password (bcryptjs) → create User record
2. **Login**: Find user by username → `bcrypt.compare()` → return user object → JWT token created
3. **JWT Callback**: Injects `user.id` into token
4. **Session Callback**: Exposes `token.id` as `session.user.id`

### 16.3 Route Protection

The `authorized()` callback in `auth.config.ts`:

| Route | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `/` (landing) | If logged in → redirect to `/app`; otherwise allow |
| `/login`, `/register` | If logged in → redirect to `/app`; otherwise allow |
| `/app/*` | If logged in → allow; otherwise → redirect to `/login` |
| `/api/*` | Always pass through (handle own auth) |
| Public routes | Always allow |

### 16.4 Authorization

- All server actions verify `session.user.id` before executing
- Ownership checks on update/delete operations (e.g., portfolio item belongs to requesting user)
- Public portfolio respects `isPublic` flag
- Cron endpoint requires `CRON_SECRET` bearer token in production

### 16.5 Input Validation

All user inputs are validated with **Zod schemas** (see Section 11 for full schema details).
